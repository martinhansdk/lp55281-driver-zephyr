  pwm-frequency:
    type: int
    default: 10000
    description: The PWM frequency in Hz.
    enum:
      - 10000
      - 20000
      - 40000

  boost-voltage:
    type: int

  autoload:
    type: boolean
    description: "Disabling increases the efficiency at light loads, but the downside is that pulse skipping will occur. The boost converter must be stopped when there is no load to
minimize the current consumption."

    led-current:
      default: [3, 3, 3]
      type: array
      description: "The current setting to use for each color in percentage of the maximum current. 0=25% of max, 1=50% of max, 2=75% of max, 3=max"
